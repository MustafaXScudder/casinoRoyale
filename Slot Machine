How It Works:

HTML (index.html):
Defines the structure of the game.
Links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
CSS (styles.css):
Styles the game, including the spinning animation.
JavaScript (script.js):
Handles the game logic, including spinning, winning, and resetting.


User Interaction:
The user enters a bet and clicks "Spin."
The spin function validates the bet, updates the balance, and starts the spinning animation.

Spinning Animation:
The reels spin for 2 seconds (SPIN_DURATION), with symbols changing rapidly every 100ms (SYMBOL_CHANGE_INTERVAL).
The spinning animation is applied when the .spinning class is added to the reels.
The win/loss messages are styled dynamically using the .winning and .losing classes.

Final Result:
After the spin ends, the reels display the final results.
The checkWin function determines if the user won and updates the balance and message accordingly.

Reset:
The "Reset Balance" button resets the balance and clears the message.
